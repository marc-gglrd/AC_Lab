% To plot 'Behavioral patterns' (standard mode, 1000 iterations):
% - for Avoidance 0.1:   run 'aclab_go('av01',0,1000);'
% - for Avoidance 0.5:   run 'aclab_go('av05',0,1000);'
% - for Avoidance 0.9:   run 'aclab_go('av09',0,1000);'
% - for Ambivalence 0.1: run 'aclab_go('am01',0,1000);'
% - for Ambivalence 0.4: run 'aclab_go('am04',0,1000);'
% - for Ambivalence 0.9: run 'aclab_go('am09',0,1000);'
% - for Phobicity 0.1:   run 'aclab_go('ph01',0,1000);'
% - for Phobicity 0.5:   run 'aclab_go('ph05',0,1000);'
% - for Phobicity 0.9:   run 'aclab_go('ph09',0,1000);'

% To plot 'Mean values and trends':
% - for Avoidance:   run 'plot_reports(1,0,0)'
% - for Ambivalence: run 'plot_reports(0,1,0)'
% - for Phobicity:   run 'plot_reports(0,0,1)'

% To plot 'Simulated vs expected dynamics':
% - for Avoidance:   run 'plot_DYNAMICS_targets(1,0,0)'
% - for Ambivalence: run 'plot_DYNAMICS_targets(0,1,0)'
% - for Phobicity:   run 'plot_DYNAMICS_targets(0,0,1)'
